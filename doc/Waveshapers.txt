	A typical "waveshaper" is some function which takes an input sample value
	X and transforms it to an output sample X'. A typical implementation would
	be a look-up table of some number of points, and some level of interpolation
	between those points (say, cubic). When people talk about a wave shaper,
	this is most often what they mean. Note that a wave shaper, as opposed to a
	filter, does not have any state. The mapping from X -> X' is stateless.

	Some wave shapers are implemented as polynomials, or using other math
	functions. Hard clipping is a wave shaper implemented using the min() and
	max() functions (or the three-argument clamp() function, which is the same
	thing). A very mellow and musical-sounding distortion is implemented using
	a third-degree polynomial; something like X' = (3/2)X - (1/2)X^3. The nice
	thing with polynomial wave shapers is that you know that the maximum they
	will expand bandwidth is their order. Thus, you need to oversample 3x to
	make sure that a third-degree polynomial is aliasing free. With a lookup
	table based wave shaper, you don't know this (unless you treat an N-point
	table as an N-point polynomial :-)

	Code:
	return 1.5f * in - 0.5f * in *in * in;

	Notes:
	A favourite of mine is using a sin() function instead.
	This will have the "unfortunate" side effect of removing
	odd harmonics if you take it to the extreme: a triangle
	wave gets mapped to a pure sine wave.
	This will work with a going from .1 or so to a= 5 and bigger!
	The mathematical limits for a = 0 actually turns it into a linear
	function at that point, but unfortunately FPUs aren't that good
	with calculus :-) Once a goes above 1, you start getting clipping
	in addition to the "soft" wave shaping. It starts getting into
	more of an effect and less of a mastering tool, though :-)

	Seeing as this is just various forms of wave shaping, you
	could do it all with a look-up table, too. In my version, that would
	get rid of the somewhat-expensive sin() function.

	Code:
	(input: a == "overdrive amount")

	z = M_PI * a;
	s = 1/sin(z)
	b = 1/a

	if (x > b)
		f(x) = 1
	else
		f(x) = sin(z*x)*s
