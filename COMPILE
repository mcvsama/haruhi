Requires GCC 4.7.3 or newer to compile.

You will need at least following packages (names are for Arch Linux):
 • jack-audio-connection-kit
 • alsa-lib
 • qt4
 • fftw3
 • boost
 • util-linux-ng

If you're using Ubuntu, packages are named as follows:
 • libjack-dev
 • libasound2-dev
 • fftw3-dev
 • libboost-1.40-dev
 • uuid-dev
 • qt4-dev-tools
 • libqt4-dev

You will probably need GNU make to compile.

Edit Makefile.conf, configure your CXXFLAGS and other features. You may need to also alter
Makefile.conf, depending on your distibuton (LDFLAGS and maybe LIBS and PKGCONFIG_* variables).

There are several targets in Makefile.conf. Use DIST variable to select target and something like:

 $ DIST=i686 make

Executable will be created in dist/$DIST/haruhi (in this case: dist/i686/haruhi).

You might need to adjust your system configuration to make it work with JACK.
If you experience segmentation faults or Out-of-memory exceptions from Haruhi, you may have restrictions
on maximum locked memory by JACK daemon and clients. Please try to enable "No memory lock" in Qjackctl
or use --no-mlock option to jackd or otherwise check limits in /etc/security/limits.conf (Google for
"jackd limits.conf").
